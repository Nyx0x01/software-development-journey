My personal problem-solving journey in C++, OOP, Algorithms and more
# 🧠 My Software Development Journey

This repository documents my personal journey as I build strong foundations in backend development. It includes my problem-solving process, code solutions, and insights as I study algorithms, data structures, OOP, and C#.

I use this repo to:
- Practice problem-solving in C++
- Learn object-oriented design
- Build confidence in backend logic
- Track my progress as I grow
- And more
